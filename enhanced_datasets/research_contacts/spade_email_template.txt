Subject: Request for SPADE Dataset Access - Voice Analysis Research

Dear SPADE Dataset Authors,

I am writing to request access to the SPADE (Big Five-Mturk Dataset) for academic research purposes. I am working on enhancing voice-based personality analysis systems and would greatly benefit from your dataset's argumentative speech samples with Big Five personality labels.

Research Purpose:
- Developing improved personality trait recognition from speech
- Comparing different acoustic feature extraction methods
- Building scientifically-grounded voice analysis models

I understand the dataset contains:
- 436 psycholinguistic features
- Socio-demographic data (age, gender, education, language background)  
- Big Five personality trait annotations

I commit to:
- Using the data solely for academic research
- Properly citing your work in any publications
- Following ethical guidelines for human subject data

Could you please provide information about the access process and any required agreements?

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Institution]
[Your Email]
