Subject: Supplementary Data Request - Speech-based Personality Prediction Study

Dear Authors,

I am writing regarding your recent publication in Scientific Reports (2024): "Speech-based personality prediction using deep learning with acoustic and linguistic embeddings."

I am particularly interested in the dataset of 2,045 participants with personality questionnaires and speech samples. This would be invaluable for my research on improving voice-based psychological analysis systems.

Research Application:
- Enhancing personality trait recognition accuracy
- Developing better acoustic-linguistic feature fusion
- Building production-ready voice analysis systems

I understand from your paper that the dataset includes:
- IPIP personality questionnaire responses (50 questions, 10 per trait)
- Free-form self-introduction speech samples  
- Demographic distribution representative of UK population
- Both acoustic and linguistic embeddings

Would it be possible to access this dataset or a subset for research purposes? I am happy to sign any required data use agreements and follow ethical guidelines for participant data.

I would be glad to share any research findings that result from this work.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
