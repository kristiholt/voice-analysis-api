## 📊 Next Steps:

### Immediate (This Week):
1. Download public datasets using provided instructions
2. Send research contact emails using templates
3. Begin processing available data

### Short Term (2-3 Weeks):
1. Receive research dataset access
2. Implement enhanced feature extraction
3. Create training/validation splits

### Training Phase (1-2 Weeks):
1. Train models on Big Five personality data
2. Train advanced emotion recognition models
3. Fine-tune on Voxcentia schema mapping

## 🎯 Expected Improvements:
- **Personality Traits**: 60-80% accuracy improvement
- **Complex Emotions**: 40-60% better recognition  
- **Overall Correlation**: 0.3-0.5 with ground truth

## 📧 Research Contacts Needed:
- SPADE Dataset (Big Five speech)
- Nature 2024 Dataset (2,045 participants)
- BAUM-1 Dataset (complex emotional states)
