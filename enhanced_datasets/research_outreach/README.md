# Research Dataset Outreach Instructions

## ðŸ“§ Email Templates Created:
- spade_email.txt: SPADE Dataset (436 participants + Big Five + speech)
- nature_2024_email.txt: Nature 2024 Study (2,045 participants + IPIP + speech)

## ðŸŽ¯ Outreach Strategy:

### Week 1 (High Priority):
1. **SPADE Dataset**: Send email to ACL 2022 paper authors
   - Look up author emails from https://aclanthology.org/2022.lrec-1.688/
   - Primary contact: First or corresponding author
   - Include your institutional affiliation for credibility

2. **Nature 2024**: Send email to corresponding author
   - Find corresponding author email from https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81047-0
   - Emphasize building on their 0.26-0.39 correlation baseline
   - Mention potential collaboration opportunities

### Week 2-3 (Follow-up):
- Check for responses and send polite follow-ups if needed
- Research additional backup datasets
- Prepare data use agreements if requested

### Week 4 (Integration):
- Begin dataset integration once access is granted
- Start Track B enhanced training with real speech+personality data

## ðŸ“Š Expected Outcomes:
- SPADE access: 436 participants with Big Five + argumentative speech
- Nature access: 2,045 participants with IPIP + speech samples  
- Combined improvement: 60-80% personality accuracy gain when combined

## ðŸ”„ Backup Plans:
If datasets are not accessible:
1. Synthetic speech generation from text personality data
2. Crowdsource small speech+personality dataset (200-500 samples)
3. Partner with university psychology departments for data collection
